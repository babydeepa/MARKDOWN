>*Documentation is key to the success of any project. Making documentation accessible enables people to learn about a project; making it easy to update ensures that documentation stays relevant.*

Two common ways to document a project are README files and wikis:
  * README files are a quick and simple way for other users to learn more about your work.
  * Wikis on GitHub help you present in-depth information about your project in a useful way.

You can add code snippet to README.md so that the readers can understand better.
Enclose the code snippet in back ticks to highlight the code.

```Here goes the code :)
#include<iostream.h>
void main()
{
}
```
